# 3D_data_structure-algorithm_visualizer
3D Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web-based project that visually demonstrates fundamental searching and sorting algorithms using 3D animations. Built with Three.js, this project helps learners understand algorithm behavior step-by-step through real-time visual execution, adjustable speed control, and intuitive mouse-based 3D interaction
